# Mapping Earthquakes
Module 14

## The Data
Natural disasters can be very scary and detrimental to society, which is why it is extremely important for these natural disasters to be analyzed in real time to limit the potential damage. With our focus being earthquakes, we will gather information on all earthquake within the past 7 days. With the use of JavaScript, Leaflet, geoJSON data, html.. We will create a map that plots all earthquakes, especially earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5, so we can easily spot where the areas of concern are. We will add a tectonic plate layer to our map to view the relationship between where the tectonic plates are compared to where the earthquakes are located.
## Results - Mapping Portion
The webpage will allow you to view a full-size mapping feature, with multiple functionalities built into it. The default page will land on a map analyzing all earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes. The first view will be the street view, which can be seen below:

In addition to the street-view, we also have made the satellite view available.  T=Alternative map views can be extremely helpful when analyzing locations, it can allow for you to easily dive deeper into certain areas simply just be zooming in and viewing major highways, cities, geographic areas, etc. The satellite view can be seen below:

Lastly, we have the dark map view, which is slightly simpler than the satellite view. It provides all the same information regarding earthquakes and tectonic plates, but it doesn’t easily highlight interstate routes a geographical view. This view can be seen below:

## Utilizing Overlays
When analyzing earthquakes, it’s great to see all earthquakes mapped out, as well as the tectonic plates to find correlations between the two; But it’s also good to be able to separate out the major earthquakes. By creating an overlay containing major earthquake locations, we can easily determine where the most impactful and earthquakes are located, especially because the pose more of threat to the public. See the overlay views below:

This map allows you to view the data in many viewpoints and layers, which allows for an accurate view of earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.
